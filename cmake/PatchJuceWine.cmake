# 1) Software renderer under Wine.
#
# JUCE 8 creates every Windows plugin window with the Direct2D renderer, and it builds the
# Direct2D swapchain inside the window's constructor. Under Wine/Proton (e.g. FL Studio in
# Lutris) that swapchain never shows anything, and once it has been attached to the window,
# switching to the software renderer later doesn't help - the window stays black.
# This makes JUCE pick the software (GDI) renderer at window creation when running under
# Wine, detected via ntdll's wine_get_version export. Real Windows keeps Direct2D.

# 2) Out-of-bounds read when a text run shapes to zero glyphs.
#
# JUCE 8.0.4's line breaker walks backwards from glyphs.cend() without checking for an empty
# glyph list. That happens when a font fails to load (under Wine, JUCE asks for "Bitstream
# Vera Sans", which most prefixes don't have), and it crashes the host with an access
# violation reading address 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFE9. Later JUCE versions rewrote this code.
